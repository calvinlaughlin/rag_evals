    ## Introduction
    
    This report presents a comparative analysis of different PDF ingestion strategies
    for large language model applications. We evaluated three main approaches:
    structured chunking, fixed-size rolling windows, and sentence-level overlap chunking.
    
    ## Performance Comparison

    As shown in Figure 1, the sentence-level overlap chunking strategy achieved the
    highest retrieval performance, followed by structured chunking and fixed-size
    rolling windows.

    Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of error types across all strategies.
    Semantic errors were the most common, followed by boundary errors and context loss.

    Figure 3 shows how each strategy performs across different document types.
    Structured chunking performs best on technical documents, while sentence-level
    overlap excels on narrative text.
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    Based on our analysis, we recommend using sentence-level overlap chunking for
    general-purpose applications, with structured chunking as a strong alternative
    for technical documents with complex layouts.
